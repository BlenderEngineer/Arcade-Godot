# Procedural Planet Generator
This is intended as a sample, learning project following the series [Procedural Planet Generationo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL43PN07AM4J_7ZkZAUotpfijJSoibrvbr) on Youtube

Each commit should follow one episode of the series.

## WARNING
This code is provided as-is.

## Run
Run the project in Godot 3.3.2 official release
* Main.tscn contains the Camera setup with a reference to the planet generator
* Planet.tscn contains the code for generating the planet
* If you plan to use the result inside a project I strongly suggest removing the setget and tool keywords so as to not regenerate the mesh while in a game
